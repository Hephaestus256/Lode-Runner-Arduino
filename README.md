# Lode-Runner-Arduino

You will need the following things for this project:
1) An Arduino UNO
2) An Adafruit ILI9481 3.5 inch screen (got it from BangGood for $11)
3) Wire up the circuit diagram.  It's the JPEG.
4) Installl the SD card library and the Adafruit GFX library

I think that's all.  Let me know if I'm leaving out anything.
