# Lode-Runner-Arduino

Here is a video to see it in action:

You will need the following things for this project:
1) An Arduino UNO
2) An Adafruit ILI9481 3.5 inch screen (got it from BangGood for $11)
3) Wire up the circuit diagram.  It's the JPEG.
4) Installl the SD card library and the Adafruit GFX library
5) A mini SD card
6) Put some of the levels on the SD card off of an "lr" directory to play them.  If it sees level 000.txt, it will play it on a loop (this is to test a level).  If it does not see level 000.txt, it will start with level 001.txt, 002.txt, 003.txt, etc.
7) Put the title.txt on the lr directory too.  It will probably error out if it's not there when it starts.

I think that's all.  Let me know if I'm leaving out anything.
